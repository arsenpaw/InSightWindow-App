# InSightWindow Application

InSightWindow is designed to solve the challenge of difficult window access. Our app allows you to operate your windows remotely, providing the ability to monitor conditions, control the opening and closing, and ensure the security of your windowsâ€”all from your device.

This is the client-side application that allows you to log in/sign up, and communicate with your windows by sending and receiving data.

### Main Features
- **Real-time device control**: Easily manage your windows with our intuitive interface. You can send commands and receive useful information about your window's status.
- **Push Notifications**: Monitor and control all your devices from one platform seamlessly, with timely alerts.
- **Detailed statistics**: Stay up-to-date with insightful statistics and product news through full integration with the [InSightWindow-Server][api], ensuring high performance.
